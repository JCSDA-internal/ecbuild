# JCSDA/ecbuild

This is a fork of [ecmwf/ecbuild](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecbuild). The `feature/stable` branch of this fork tracks a known stable version of ecbuild for the JCSDA/JEDI toolsets, with local patches to address various build and configuration issues.  This is the recommended version of ecbuild for building [eckit](https://github.com/ecmwf/eckit) and [fckit](https://github.com/JCSDA/fckit), for use with the JCSDA/JEDI repositories, packages, and bundles.

## Current status of `feature/stable` branch

 * Based on upstream tagged version [`2.9.4`](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecbuild/blob/2.9.4/cmake/contrib/FindNetCDF4.cmake)
